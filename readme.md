This is my freeCodeCamp leaderboard. It is built with React and Bootstrap for very basic styling and mobile responsiveness.

React is valuable for a project like this since when switching between the different leaderboards, React only finds the new users that need to be loaded and sends those updates to the DOM without having to reload the entire page.

Installation and Running
Run npm install to install all of the required packages.

node run build will build the bundled js file. Node run start will serve the project on localhost, on a free prort.
